<p><strong>3.2 Carrier Billing </strong></p>
<p>Certain Sellers that accept Google Payments may permit you to have your purchase billed to your Carrier Billing Account. These additional terms apply when you use Carrier Billing through Google Payments.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>To register your Carrier Billing Account as a payment option, Google Payments requires your mobile telephone number, and the name and billing address, including zip code, of the Carrier Billing Account associated with that number. You consent to your Carrier providing this information to Google Payments , and you will review the information during sign-up for Carrier Billing, and correct any inaccuracies. This information will be used by Google Payments for the purpose of establishing your Carrier Billing Account as a Payment Instrument in your Google Payments Account, and for operating the Service. You also agree that GPC and your Carrier may share information with each other regarding your Carrier Billing activity in order to charge or credit your Carrier Billing Account and otherwise complete payments for purchases, reversals, refunds or adjustments of Payment Transactions, resolve disputes, provide customer support, and for other Carrier Billing-related purposes.</li>

  <li>You can use Carrier Billing to purchase applications (e.g., downloadable or networked applications, wallpapers, ring-tones, games, and productivity tools) ("Apps") for and with your compatible device from certain merchants on Google Play. These Apps are not sold by your Carrier, Google, GPC, or Google Play. You can identify the Seller of the App at the point of purchase.</li>
  <li>Purchases made through Carrier Billing are also subject to the terms &amp; conditions of your Carrier Billing Account. You are responsible for any charges and related fees that may be imposed under your Carrier Billing Account terms &amp; conditions as a result of your use of Carrier Billing.</li>
  <li>You may contact your Carrier's customer service if you have a question about the charges or fees billed to your Carrier Billing Account. If you have a question regarding Google Payments related matters, you may contact Google Payments customer service.</li>
  <li>You should direct support questions regarding products, such as Apps, purchased through Carrier Billing to the Seller from whom you purchased the App.</li>
  <li>None of Carrier, Google, GPC, or Google Play is responsible for any product (including an App) purchased with Carrier Billing, including download, installation, use, transmission failure, interruption, or delay, refunds, third party advertisements you may encounter while using the product or App, alterations any App may make to the functionality of your device, including any changes that may affect your Carrier's plan, service, or billing, or any content or website you may be able to access through the App.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3.3 Subscriptions/Recurring Transactions Purchases</strong></p>

<p>Your subscription will start when you click "Accept &amp; buy" on a subscription purchase. This is a recurring billing transaction. Unless otherwise stated, your subscription and the relevant billing authorization will continue indefinitely until cancelled by you. </p>
<p>By clicking 'Accept &amp; buy,' you authorize the applicable Seller to bill your chosen Payment Instrument during the subscription at the Purchase Amount. The Purchase Amount will continue to be charged to your Payment Instrument, until you cancel your subscription, unless as otherwise stated in the terms and conditions.The billing rate is subject to change by the Seller during the subscription period.</p>
<p>Your Payment Instrument will be billed each period based on the date of the subscription purchase.</p>
 
<p> You may cancel a subscription at any time, but the cancellation will not become effective until the end of the current billing period. You will not receive a refund for the current billing period. You will continue to be able to access the relevant subscription for the remainder of the current billing period.</p>
  
  
<p>We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.</p>
